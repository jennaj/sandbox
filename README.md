Set to cancel the text layout width restriction. Removing the syntax will restore HackMD's default text layout width:

```
.markdown-body, .ui-infobar {
    max-width: unset !important;
}
```

To ensure that Markdown syntax works correctly within a `div` container, please add a blank line before starting to write Markdown.

:pencil2: Feel free to customize it.
